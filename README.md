AzureAD w/ Office 365 User Termination Script

This script is being written with user friendliness being the primary goal.  Scripting includes Windows Forms for user input, instead of requiring parameters be passed in.

This script will let you choose to remove all groups, all licenses, convert to shared mailbox, and share OneDrive data with another user as needed.
